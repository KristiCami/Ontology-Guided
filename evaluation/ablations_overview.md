# Ablations & Sensitivity Overview

The ablation catalogue is now captured in the LaTeX camera-ready format of Table~\ref{tab:ablations-offline} within `evaluation/offline_tables.tex`. Each row mirrors the rationale bullets provided earlier, highlighting the toggled factor, setup deltas, and target readouts. Quantitative values remain TODO until the respective cached runs are scripted.
