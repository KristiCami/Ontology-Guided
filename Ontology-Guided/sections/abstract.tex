Natural language requirements are often ambiguous and inconsistent, hindering automated validation and reuse. We present a neuro-symbolic pipeline that transforms free-form requirements into validated OWL ontologies via a closed-loop architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), SHACL constraints, and logical reasoning. Our contributions include (i) ontology-aware LLM prompting, (ii) SHACL-guided iterative repair, (iii) hybrid reasoning and validation, and (iv) plug-and-play domain adaptability. Evaluation on an ATM case study demonstrates improved precision, recall, and constraint compliance compared to neural-only and symbolic-only baselines.
