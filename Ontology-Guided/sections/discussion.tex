\section{DISCUSSION}
Our results highlight several insights. First, LLM--only out\-puts are prone to inconsistencies and semantic drift, confirming the need for symbolic constraints. Second, symbolic--only methods achieve high precision but low recall, since hand\-crafted rules cannot cover all requirement variations. Third, the iterative repair loop consistently reduces SHACL violations, demonstrating the value of neuro--symbolic feedback. Finally, the system generalizes across domains, validating our claim of plug--and--play adaptability.

An ablation study further reveals that ontology--aware prompting contributes to both higher recall and faster re\-pair convergence, while reasoner integration improves logical soundness.
