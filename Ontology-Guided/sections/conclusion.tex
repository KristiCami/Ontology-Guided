\section{CONCLUSION}
We presented a neuro--symbolic pipeline for drafting OWL ontologies from natural language requirements. Our method integrates LLM--based generation with ontology alignment, reasoning, SHACL validation, and iterative repair. Experi\-ments across multiple domains show that the approach yields more precise and compliant ontologies than neural--only or symbolic--only baselines. Future work includes scaling to larger requirement corpora, extending the SHACL library, and exploring integration with automated code synthesis.
