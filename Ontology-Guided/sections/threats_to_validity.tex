\section{THREATS TO VALIDITY}
Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, token length limits of the LLM constrain the size of documents that can be processed in a single pass. Second, SHACL coverage depends on the completeness of the shape definitions: missing shapes may allow errors to pass undetected. Third, domain adaptation assumes the availability of domain ontologies; performance may degrade if no ontology exists for a target domain. Finally, our experiments rely on GPT--4, and results may differ with other LLMs or future versions of the API.
